# Signature Forgery Detection

## Motivation
- Signatures are used to indicate authenticity but can forged
- use ML to detect forgeries 

## How to run online

A website at https://uoft-tmi.github.io/signature-forgery-detection/home was created to 
showcase and interact with the k-nearest neighbours, decision tree, and convolutional neural network models.

Until July 2, 2025, images can be uploaded to the website where the models where be queried.
After, the models can be queried locally.

## How to run locally
Python 3.10 is required.

### Instructions
1. Make a local copy of the GitHub repository
2. Open 1 tab in Terminal and in each, navigate to the copy you made in step one
3. Then navigate to `website/backend`
4. In that tab, run `python3 manage.py runserver`
5. The endpoint should be available locally and can be run according to our API documentation
