# Signature Forgery Detection

## Motivation
- Signatures are used to indicate authenticity but can forged
- use ML to detect forgeries 

## How to run

A website at https://uoft-tmi.github.io/signature-forgery-detection/home was created to 
showcase and interact with the k-nearest neighbours, decision tree, and convolutional neural network models.

## Credits

This project was made by Dian Rong, Evelyn Phan, Angela Zhuo, 
Steven Lin, Dorothy Lee, and Puneet Kaur as a part of the 
University of Toronto's Truthworthy Machine Intelligence club.
